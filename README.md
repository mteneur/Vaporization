Vaporization is a php Lib to use Google Fusion
It's in early stage of developement. Lots of things to do.

It's just a portage of http://code.google.com/p/fusion-tables-client-php/ .

Goals are:

- Use of Php Buzz Lib https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz , instead of using directly curl interface

- Use php 5.3 conventions and fashion styles (namespace etc..)


TO DO:

- Implements Client.php which should put all object together

- Use a more conveniant Syntax to queries.
